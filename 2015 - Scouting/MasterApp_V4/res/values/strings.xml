    <string name="bio">I had the same problem and it was corrected by going to the project preferences(right click project -->preferences). Then go to "java build path" and click on the libraries tab. Look for your JRE lib in the list. In my case the system was unable to find it, but the entry was still there. Delete this and add a new one by clicking "add library" and select JRE System library. Then select the default system lib. Close out of the preferences window and then Right click on your project and go to android tools-->Fix project Properties. Clean your project and try building again.</string>
